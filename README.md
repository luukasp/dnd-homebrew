# Neko-chan's Guide to All Things Homebrew - A Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition Homebrew Rulebook

## What is Neko-chan's Guide to All Things Homebrew?
Neko-chan's Guide to All Things Homebrew is a Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition homebrew rulebook. It is designed to provide deeper, more intricate characters and more great interactions between characters and the world. It is designed to be used in conjunction with the already existing Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition rulebooks, and is not intended to be used on its own.

**Recommended Source Materials:**

In addition to the essential DnD core books — Player's Handbook, Monster Manual, and Dungeon Master's Guide — we highly recommend incorporating the following supplemental materials into your campaign:

- *Tasha's Cauldron of Everything*
- *Xanathar's Guide to Everything*
- *Volo's Guide to Monsters*
- *Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes*
- *Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide*

These additional resources can enrich your gaming experience and provide a wealth of options for both players and Dungeon Masters. We may draw inspiration from or reference content within these books for our homebrew rules. To ensure a comprehensive understanding of our homebrew content, it's advisable to have access to these recommended materials.

If a particular rule or homebrew directly utilizes content from any of these recommended books, we will clearly specify this in the "Based on" section of that particular rule or homebrew. Familiarity with these source materials enhances the collaborative storytelling experience within our additions.
