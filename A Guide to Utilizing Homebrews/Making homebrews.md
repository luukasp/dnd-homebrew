# A Guide to Making Homebrews

Making homebrews is an art like no other in the world of Dungeons and Dragons. Here we will outline how to make and balance a homebrew.

## Where to start making a homebrew?

When you or party find a problem with the rules, a thing you want to do that's not in the rules or simply want to add another item or spell to the game, you can make a homebrew. The primary consideration is a homebrew is "will it be fun for all players?" If the answer is yes, then you can and should make a homebrew.

To start making a homebrew, you should first discuss about it with the rest of the group. A homebrew is always better when tailored specifically to the needs of ***your*** group. If you are the DM, you should also consider if the homebrew is something you want to add to your campaign.

After you have discussed it, you can start making it. The best place to start is to think about how it will/should affect your campaing ([See: Utilizing Homebrews](Utilizing%20Homebrews.md))

## How do I balance a homebrew?

A homebrew does not need to be balanced. You want to have a wooden sword that deals `2d12` necro damage? Ask your DM for approval and go wild. However, if you want to make a homebrew that is balanced, you should consider the following:
* **What level is it available from?** - A homebrew spell that is available from level 1 should probably not do that `2d12` necro damage, but a spell from level 10 could.
* **How does it affect the players?** This is more a DM consideration, but you should consider how it affects your players. An enemy that can instantly kill players at level 1, because it does `8d10` damage on a hit, is probably not a good idea to introduce straight away.
* **How does it affect the world?** This is also more a DM consideration, but you should consider how it affects your world. A new way of travel might be a good idea for a large campaing, but for instance, allowing players to demolish the king's castle using magic missile is not.
* **Does it need to be balanced?** This is the most important consideration. Is the idea on it's own balanced enough? Do you actually need balance? If you are making a homebrew for a one-shot, you probably don't need to balance it. If you are making a homebrew for a large campaing, you probably do.
* **Finally: It's up to you to decide.** Why should you listen to me or the other contributors of this guide? We are not Wizards of the Coast, and we are not your DM. We can give you advice, but in the end, it's up to you to decide how you make your homebrew.

## A step-by-step guide for making a new spell

Let's say that you want to make a new spell, called `Unrelenting Force` (Yes, I know it's from Skyrim, I picked it on purpose). Let's build that spell step-by-step.

---
### Step 1: Decide on the spells details

In this step, you decide on the spells details. In our case we know that the name is `Unrelenting Force`. We also want it to be verbally cast (See: Player's Handbook > Spellcasting > Components), so we will add a verbal (V) component to it. As we want it to work like it's inspiration in Skyrim, we will make it a 1st level evocation spell. We also want it to be available to sorcerers so we will make it a sorcerer spell. As for casting time, I want it to be instant.

After these considerations, we have the following spell details:

* **Name:** Unrelenting Force
* **Type:** 1st level evocation spell
* **Casting time:** Instant
* **Components:** Verbal (V)

The class is not defined in the spell, instead the spell would be added to the class spell list. The spell level is not defined in the spell, instead the spell level is defined by the spell slot used to cast it.

### Step 2: Decide on the spells effects

Now that we have the details, we need to decide on the effects. In the game, Unrelenting Force pushes enemies away from you. We will make it do so by utilizing a homebrew rule, let's call it "Spells can push enemies around". We will also make it deal damage, as it does in the game. We will make it deal `1d6` force damage.

As we have a rule to write, we can write it like this: Spells that are assigned the "Will Push Enemies" value can push tiny, small and medium creatures back from the casters location by `1d6` feet. If the creature is against a wall, it can not be pushed further. If the creature is pushed into another creature, both creatures take `1d6` force damage.

As Unrelenting Force is a close quarters shout in Skyrim, we will give the spell a range of 30 feet.

After these considerations, we have the following spell effects:

* **Effects:** Will Push Enemies, Deals `1d6` force damage. A creature hit by this spell can try to make a DC 15 Strength saving throw to avoid being pushed back. If the creature is pushed into another creature, both creatures take `1d6` force damage.
  * **At higher levels** At higher levels, the damage increases by `1d6` on the 6th, 12th and 18th level.
* **Range:** 30 feet

### Step 3: Additional considerations

I wont put anything here myself, but if you want to limit it to certain cases or add saving throws, concentration or conditions, you can do so here.

### Final result

After these considerations, we have the following spell:

* **Name:** Unrelenting Force
* **Type:** 1st level evocation spell
* **Casting time:** Instant
* **Components:** Verbal (V)
* **Effects:** Will Push Enemies, Deals `1d6` force damage. A creature hit by this spell can try to make a DC 15 Strength saving throw to avoid being pushed back. If the creature is pushed into another creature, both creatures take `1d6` force damage.
  * **At higher levels** At higher levels, the damage increases by `1d6` on the 6th, 12th and 18th level.
* **Range:** 30 feet
