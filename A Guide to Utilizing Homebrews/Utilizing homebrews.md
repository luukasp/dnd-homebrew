# How to Utilize a Homebrew

Utilizing homebrews is a great way to add more depth to your game. In this chapter, we will go over how to utilize homebrews in your game.

While utilizing a homebrew can be easy, it's also an art. For instance, the "The Rule of Cool Over Realism" homebrew rule is a great way to make your game more interesting, but if you use it too much, it can make your game less interesting. It's up to you to decide how much you want to utilize a homebrew.

## How do I know when to utilize a homebrew?

If you feel like a certain scenario benefits from utilizing a homebrew, go for it. For instance, a dragonborn barbarian getting burned by a dragon and deciding it's their turn to do the same might benefit from the "The Rule of Cool Over Realism" homebrew rule. In this scenario, while said dragonborn might only deal `4d6` damage using breath weapon, the DM can decide that the character deals, for instance `20d6` damage instead, because it is fuming with anger and wants to get revenge. This is a good example of utilizing a homebrew.

Conversly, utilizing a homebrew in a situation that doesn't need it, such as rolling persuasion to get a discount might not be the best situation. It's already comprehensive enough with the normal rules. Exceptions for this can be given by homebrew traits like "Socially Inept", which disallows charisma checks.
