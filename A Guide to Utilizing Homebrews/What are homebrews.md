# What are Dungeons and Dragons homebrews?

A homebrew is an additional feature, class, race or similar thing added by the players, the dungeon master, or both. They are not official content, and are not endorsed by Wizards of the Coast. They are, however, a great way to add more depth to your game.

In this collection, we give you a bunch of homebrews you can utilize yourself and some tips on how to make your own.

## How do I use homebrews?

A group may decide to add homebrew rules to better tailor the Dungeons and Dragons experience to their own liking. For instance, my group has a homebrew rule called "The Rule of Cool Over Realism", which is explained in [How to Make a Campaing More Interesting](), but the short version is: "Sometimes cool is more fun than by-the-book realism."

A homebrew should always be agreed upon by the group, and should be used to enhance the experience, not to make it worse. If a homebrew is making the game less fun, it should be removed. Usually homebrews can be suggested by the DM and the players, but the DM has the final say.

## Why should I use homebrews?

If you as a DM or player feel like something is lacking or that there is potential to do something that everyone would like, but is not mentioned in the official rules, a homebrew rule is a way to fix that. For instance, if you feel like the official rules for a certain class are lacking, you can make a homebrew class or subclass that fixes that.

## How do I make a homebrew?

Making a homebrew is actully pretty simple. You just need to follow a few steps:
* **Step 1:** Identify the problem. What is it that you want to fix? What is it that you want to add?
* **Step 2:** Identify the solution. How do you fix the problem? How do you add the thing you want to add?
* **Step 3:** Write it down. Write down the solution in a way that is easy to understand and easy to use.
* **Step 4:** Utilize it. Use the homebrew in your game and see if it works. If it doesn't, go back to step 1.

Also, if you have a homebrew and feel like it would be a great addition to this guide, please submit a pull request. We would love to see what you have made.
